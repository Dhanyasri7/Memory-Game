## ⚡ Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the repository  
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build


---

👉 You just need to replace:  
- `https://your-site-name.netlify.app` → with your **Netlify live link**  
- `https://github.com/your-username/memory-game.git` → with your GitHub repo link  
- Add a `screenshot.png` inside your repo’s `assets/` folder for preview

Do you want me to make this **README fancy with emojis, colors, and badges** (like Netlify Deploy badge, React badge etc.), or do you prefer keeping it **simple and professional**?

git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-game.git
cd memory-game
